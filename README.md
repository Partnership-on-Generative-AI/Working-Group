# Humanitarian AI Working Group

It's difficult for staff from organizations interested in humanitarian applications of artificial intelligence to get to know one another and develop working relationships. The **Humanitarian AI working Group** is a lightweight, semi-private networking initiative being organized to expand and strengthen connections between members.

Through the working group and the group's [Humanitarian AI Roster](https://github.com/Partnership-on-Generative-AI/Working-Group/blob/main/Roster.md), members can share information about themselves, their organizations, internal AI discussions, project and event news and seek technical assistance through the [Partnership on Generative AI for Humanitarian Applications](https://github.com/Partnership-on-Generative-AI/About), a lightweight code-sharing initiative.

## Get Involved

The Working Group is an all-volunteer initiative coordinated by Cecilia Cartling Wallén, Brent Phillips and others, launched in collaboration with the **Humanitarian AI Today** podcast series. To share your interest in potentially joining the working group, please complete this [Questionnaire](https://forms.gle/zX31SHrjgQ8k9rvN8). For more information, contact: team(at)pgai.dev

## Humanitarian AI Promptathon

Currently, the working group is participating in organizing [Humanitarian AI Promptathons](https://github.com/Partnership-on-Generative-AI/Working-Group/blob/main/Promptathon.md) focusing on collecting sample questions that staff from humanitarian organizations might like to ask new question-answering AI applications. The questions are needed by researchers to train and test machine learning models.
