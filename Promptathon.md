## Get Involved in Humanitarian AI Research

Humanitarian actors are channeling information through platforms like [ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/) and open data sharing frameworks like [IATI](https://iatistandard.org/en/) and the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/). 
Researchers studying how emerging generative AI powered question-answering applications can answer complex questions posed by humanitarian actors require sample questions to train, fine-tune and test their machine learning models.

### Humanitarian AI Promptathons

Volunteers from [Omdena](https://www.omdena.com/) and the Humanitarian AI Meetup Community are working together to organize **Humanitarian AI Promptathons** to crowdsource questions needed by researchers.

Weâ€™re inviting our members and also staff from humanitarian and development organizations from the grassroots level up to the United Nations to join the project and help contribute questions. Participants can get started by submitting three easy questions via this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/wh8SXVyhWro46yA8A). Next, participants can use the form to share their names and email addresses to share their interest in getting more involved in the project. Volunteers will help contribute and label a wide range of questions and help evaluate questions and generate output notes as well as join in testing machine learning models.

Periodically, we will be organizing live **work sessions** through the Humanitarian AI meetup community and its local groups in fifteen cities. These will give participants opportunities to get to know one another virtually and help generate and discuss new questions to add to our list.
