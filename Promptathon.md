# Get Involved in Humanitarian AI Research

Humanitarian actors are channeling information through platforms like [ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/) and through open data sharing frameworks like [IATI](https://iatistandard.org/en/) and the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/). 
Researchers studying how new generative AI powered question-answering applications can traverse these information sources to answer complex questions posed by humanitarian actors require sample questions to train, fine-tune and test their machine learning models.

## Humanitarian AI Promptathons

Volunteers from [Omdena](https://www.omdena.com/) and from the Humanitarian AI Meetup Community are working together to organize **Humanitarian AI Promptathons** to help crowdsource questions needed by researchers.

Weâ€™re inviting staff from humanitarian organizations from the grassroots level up to the United Nations to join the project and help contribute questions. Participants can get involved by submitting three easy questions via this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/wh8SXVyhWro46yA8A). Next, participants can use the form to share their names and email addresses if they'd like to get more involved in the project. Volunteers will help contribute, label and evaluate a wide range of questions and question outputs as well as join in testing opportunities helping prototype machine learning models and humanitarian AI applications.

## Volunteer Work Sessions

Periodically, we will be organizing live Humanitarian AI Promptathons. These informal **work sessions** will give participants opportunities to get to know one another and help generate and discuss new questions to add to our list. For more information, contact: team (at) humanitarianai.org
