## Get Involved in Humanitarian AI Research

Humanitarian actors are channeling information on crises, needs and aid activities through open data sharing frameworks like IATI and the Humanitarian Data Exchange and via platforms like ReliefWeb. Researchers studying how large language model powered question-answering applications can traverse the information need hundreds of sample questions to test their machine learning models.

### Humanitarian AI Promptathons

Omdena and the the Humanitarian AI Meetup Community are working together to crowdsource sample questions that humanitarian acotrs might like to ask a generative AI powered chatbot.
