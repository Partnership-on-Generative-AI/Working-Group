# Humanitarian AI Roster

It's difficult for individuals and organizations interested in humanitarian applications of artificial intelligence to get to know one another and develop working relationships on a peer-to-peer level. The **Humanitarian AI working Group** is principally interested in strengthening and expanding these relationships and in providing members with useful resources, particularly on a technical level.

We're starting a **Humanitarian AI Roster** to provide individuals and organizations with a channel to use to **register** themselves for the benefit of others and themselves. Members can use the roster to register events and discussions that they are organizing, to share information on discussions and projects that they are working on and to seek assistance and learning opportunities.

## Humanitarian AI Roster Questionnaire

We're circulating an initial questionnaire to get to know individuals who might be interested in joining the roster and sharing information with their peers.
