# Humanitarian AI Roster

It's difficult for staff from organizations interested in humanitarian applications of artificial intelligence to get to know one another and develop working relationships. The **Humanitarian AI working Group** is a lightweight, semi-private networking initiative being organized to expand and strengthen connections between members.

Our **Humanitarian AI Roster** provides individuals interested in joining the working group with an easy way to privately share information about themselves with working group administrators and set their privacy preferences prior to making their information accessible to the group. Through the working group and roster, members can share information about themselves, their organizations, internal AI discussions, project and event news and seek technical assistance through the [Partnership on Generative AI for Humanitarian Applications](https://github.com/Partnership-on-Generative-AI/About), a lightweight code-sharing initiative.

## Humanitarian AI Roster Questionnaire

We're circulating an initial **questionnaire** to get to know individuals interested in joining the networking initiative. The Google form can be found here: [Questionnaire](https://forms.gle/zX31SHrjgQ8k9rvN8)

The Working Group is an all-volunteer initiative coordinated by Cecilia Cartling Wallén, Brent Phillips and others, launched in collaboration with the **Humanitarian AI Today** podcast series. For more information, contact: team(at)pgai.dev
