# Humanitarian AI Roster

It's difficult for staff from organizations interested in humanitarian applications of artificial intelligence to get to know one another and develop working relationships. The **Humanitarian AI working Group** is a lightweight, semi-private networking initiative being organized to expand and strengthen connections between members.

Our **Humanitarian AI Roster** provides individuals interested in joining the working group an easy way to privately share more information about themselves with working group administrators and set their privacy preferences prior to making their information accessible to the group. Through the working group and roster, members can share information about themselves, their organizations, internal discussions on AI, project and event news and seek technical assistance through the [Partnership on Generative AI for Humanitarian Applications](https://github.com/Partnership-on-Generative-AI/About), a lightweight code-sharing initiative.

## Humanitarian AI Roster Questionnaire

We're circulating an initial **questionnaire** to get to know individuals interested in joining the networking initiative and getting to know their peers.
